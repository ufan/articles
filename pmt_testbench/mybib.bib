	abstract = {Antimatter spectrometer (AMS)-02 is a spaceborne magnetic spectrometer designed to measure with accuracies up to one part in 109 the composition of cosmic rays near the Earth. With a large acceptance (5000 cm2 sr), an intense magnetic field from a superconducting magnet (0.7 T) and an accurate particle identifications AMS-02 will provide the highest accuracy in cosmic rays measurements up to the TeV region. During a 3-year long mission on the International Space Station (ISS) AMS-02 will achieve a sensitivity to the existence of anti-He in the cosmic rays of one part in a billion as well as important informations on the origin of Dark Matter. We review the status of the construction of the AMS-02 experiment in preparation for the 3-year mission on the ISS.},

	abstract = {The PAMELA satellite experiment is dedicated to the study of charged particles in cosmic radiation, with a particular focus on antiparticles for the search of antimatter and signals of dark matter, in the energy window from 100 MeV to some hundreds of GeV. PAMELA is installed on board of the Resurs DK1 satellite that was launched from the Baikonur cosmodrome on June 15th, 2006. The PAMELA apparatus comprises a magnetic spectrometer, a time-of-flight system, a silicon–tungsten electromagnetic calorimeter, an anticoincidence system, a shower tail catcher scintillator and a neutron detector. The combination of these devices allows antiparticles to be reliably identified from a large background of other charged particles.},

The broad list of exciting scientific results that the observatory has achieved in the first year of operation, though, is not limited to photon science, as it includes the first high-statistics measurement of the cosmic-ray electron spectrum for energies above 20 GeV. Here we thoroughly discuss the main aspects of the data analysis underlying this measurement and present the ongoing study aimed at lowering the energy threshold of the primary spectrum (measured by the LAT) as well as exploring the properties of the electron albedo population.},
