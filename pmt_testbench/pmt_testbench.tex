%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%  Introduction  %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

\begin{comment}
DArk Matter Paricle Explorer(DAMPE)~\cite{Chang_Jin_dampe} is a satellite-borne particle detector for dark matter search and cosmic ray study.
It is designed to cover the energy range from 5~GeV to 10~TeV for electrons and photons with an energy resolution of 1\% at 800~GeV, from 100~GeV to 1~PeV for heavy ions with an energy resolution better than 40\% at 800~GeV.

Plastic scintillator Strip Detector(PSD), which sits at the topmost of the satellite, is a key component of DAMPE detector.
By measuring the energy deposit of particles pentrating through it, PSD serves as a anti-coincidence detector for e/$\gamma$ discrimination as well as a detector for charge measurement up to Z=20.
PSD consists of 82 plastic scintillator strips(EJ-200~\cite{ej200}) of dimention $864mm\times28mm\times10mm$, each readout at both ends by a Hamamastu R4443-Mod2 photomultiplier tube.
These strips are arranged into two orthogonally oriented layers, convering an effective area of $820mm\times820mm$.
Each PMT is readout at both dynode 5 and dynode 8 with different gains to cover the large dynamic range from $\sim$0.5~MIPs to $\sim$700~MIPs.
The readout signals are processed by a highly-sensitive ASIC chip(VA32) with the range of 0-14~pC, and then digitized by an ADC with 14~bits resolution.

Unlike groud-based experiments, the power supply system of DAMPE payload can only provide discrete high voltage levels with an interval of 30~V.
Furthermore, every 6 or 7 PMTs of PSD form a HV-group and share the same high voltage channel.
In this case, the ususal method of fine-tuning individual PMT's high voltage to get optimal gain is not available.  
The characteristics of PMTs in the same HV-group should have similar dependency on voltage.
Thus a careful selection of the tubes is mandatory to get uniform energy response across the whole detector and optimal utilization of the mesuring range.
For this selection, the gain of dynode 5 and dynode 8 as a function of supplying voltage needs to be measured precisely.  

Considering the large number of tubes involved in the Selection phase and Qualification phase, a PMT test bench for bulk testing was designed and contructed to facilitate this work.
500 bare R4443-Mod2 tubes were thoroughly tested and 200 of them were selected for production and qualification.
Finally, 164 PMT modules with the optimal characteristics were installed.
While mainly developped for the DAMPE-PSD project, this test bench has been designed to be as versatile as possible and can be upgaded seamlessly for future experiments.
The detailed description of the test bench will be given in Sec.\ref{sec:description}.Some key characteristics of the test bench is summarized in Sec.\ref{sec:char_testbench}.
The testing results of PSD PMTs and the corresponding selection procedure will be discussed in Sec.\ref{sec:pmt_test}.

%%Photomultiplier tubes(PMTs) are widely used as photosensors in various fields, such as particle detectors in experimental physics and medical equipments in medical diagnosis.
%%PMT features in high sensitivity, large gain and easy-operation, whic make it still popular about 80 years after its invention.
Photomultiplier tubes(PMTs) are widely used as photosensors in particle detectors.
They are ususally charaterized thoroughly in the laboratoy before using, as the parameters provided by the manufacturer only give a rough indication of the performance.
These tests are citical for the following reasons:
\begin{itemize}
 \item Each application have specific requirements for the characteristics of PMTs.
 As PMTs exhibit big individual difference, these parameters should be tested and selection based on the testing data should be performed to reject tubes that are out of the specification.
 \item To get a uniform behavior across the whole detector system and thus better resolution, the response of PMT as a function of supplying voltage, sometimes of the cathode position, need to be determined.
  These data will be referenced both in the installation phase and operating phase. 
 \item Last but not least, qualification test for the whole PMT assembly before final mounting is mandatory for the success of any large project. 
\end{itemize}

Modern detectors can easily contain hundreds, even thousands of PMTs as detection channels.
Massive testing of all used PMTs is a tough job.
Usually, a dedicated test bench is constructed to facilitate this work and improve efficiency~\cite{barnhill_testing_2008,akgun_complete_2005,adragna_pmt-block_2006}.
Setting up a system like this is none trivial work, which demands considerable investment of time and effort.
On the other hand, testing of PMTs is a commonly encountered procedure.
Thus, it is desirable that the same test bench, with minimum configuration changes, can be reused in different applications. 

In this paper, a versatile test bench of this kind is reported.
The test bench is designed to be a standard laboratoy equipment for fast PMT characterization for several experiments prepared and planned at the Institute of Modern Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences.
Different projects have different requirements for the testing configuration.
Thus, the test bench has adoptted a modular design pattern both in the hardware and the associated software platform.
This makes the migration from one testing configuration to another light-weight and time-saving.
The design considerations of the bench are summarized in Sec.\ref{sec:design_consideration}.
Detailed description of its implementation is presented in Sec.\ref{sec:description}.

The initial application of the test bench in the PMT testing for the Plastic Scintillator Strip Detector(PSD) of DArk Matter Paricle Explorer(DAMPE)~\cite{Chang_Jin_dampe} is reported in Sec.\ref{sec:application}.
DAMPE is a statellite-borne  exeperiment, which imposes severe testing procedure for the PMT used.
PSD of DAMPE is a large-area two-layer plastic scintillator array which aims for  e/$\gamma$ discrimination as well as charge measurement up to Z=20 by measuring the energy deposited.
It requires a \SI{25}{\percent} energy uniformity across all the detection units.
Totally, 570 PMTs are charaterized and 194 of them are selected for production and qualification.
This application is successfull and has verified the efficiency and stability of the test bench.
The performance of the test bench during these tests is discussed in Sec.\ref{sec:performance}.

\section{Considerations in the design of the test bench}
\label{sec:design_consideration}

\begin{figure*}[t]
 \centering
 \includegraphics[width=160mm]{testbench_overview}
\caption{Schematic diagram of the PMT test bench system.\textit{PTVStepper}, \textit{PTVPulser}, \textit{PTVDaq} and \textit{PTVHV} are abstract classes which separate the testing software from the hardware implementation details.}
\label{fig:testbench_overveiw}
\end{figure*}

The major design considerations of the test bench summarized is as follows:
\begin{itemize}
 \item \textit{Large capacity}: This is the primary driving force for developping a test bench dedicated for PMT characterization.
 Testing multiple tubes simultaneously can increase the efficiency and save project time tremendously.
 This is a critical factor in large projects such as DAMPE PSD.
 \item \textit{Automation}: A single test run ususally takes several hours, during which most operations are trivial jobs like changing voltage, changing light intensity, starting~/~stopping DAQ.
 Manual operations are inefficient and unreliable in such a long testing period.
 Thus computer controllable hardwares should be used whenever possible and corresponding software should be developped to automate these trivial operations.
 Manual intervention is only expected in the beginning when mounting PMTs and configuring the software and in the end when unmounting PMTs and assessing testing result. 
 \item \textit{Versatility}: As indicated in Sec.\ref{sec:introduction}, the test bench is not designed for single use.
 %It will be utilitized in different experiments with different testing requirements.
 T\-h\-u\-s potential use cases should be considered and appropriate hardwares should be set up in the first place.
 In particular, positon scanning capability is desirable for characterization of large area PMTs. 
 \item \textit{Flexibility}: As a by product of versatiltiy, flexibility is needed both in terms of hardware and software.
 The hardware platform should be extensible and allow complex testing configurations.
 The software should accommodate any changes in the hardware easily, while keeping the high level functionality unchanged and portable. 
\end{itemize}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Main Text Body %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Description of the test bench}
\label{sec:description}

A schematic diagram of the final design is shown in Fig.\ref{fig:testbench_overveiw}.
The test bench can test up to 25 PMTs in a single run.
Light pulses are distributed to each tube through an integrating sphere and a fibre bundle, which are mounted on a three-dimensional motorized stage.
PMTs under test will be mounted on a separate fixed stage, thus allowing position scanning of all tubes simultaneously.
Two additional PMTs will be mounted on the motorized stage, serving as reference to monitor the stability of the light source as well as the performance of the whole system(see Sec.\ref{sec:performance}).
They will move with the light distribution system and not be removed from their fixed positions during all test runs. 
Both stages are housed in a light-tight box made of aluminium alloy, with the dimension of $176cm\times100cm\times78cm$.
The box is painted black inside and out and can be opened from the top plate for tube mounting.
All other devices are located outside the light-tight box.
Cables are led out through light-tight cable feedthroughs left in the side plate.
The test bench and all associated devices are sitted in a cleanroom of class 100000, the temperature of which is controlled around 22\textpm2\textcelsius~all the time.

In the following, key components of the test bench will be described in detail.
\subsection{Motorized and Fixed Stages}
\label{sec:stages}

The motorized and fixed stages are the main body of the test bench.
All other objects inside the light-tight box will be mounted on the top of them.
They are arranged face to face with each other and are both covered with an optical breadboard of an area $1560mm\times250mm$, as shown in Fig.\ref{fig:stages}.
The optical breadboards are made of \SI{2.5}{cm} thick stainless steel, which provides substantial resistance to deformation in this application.
The grid pattern of tapped holes on the surface facilitate mounting/unmounting operations, which not only increase efficiency but also provide extra flexibility in testing configuration.
In particular, customized fixtures for fibres and tubes have been designed for accurate poistioning.

\begin{figure}[h!]
 \centering
 \includegraphics[width=90mm]{stage1_crop}
\caption{Motorized and fixed stages before assembly.}
\label{fig:stages}
\end{figure} 

\begin{figure*}[t]
 \centering
 \includegraphics[width=90mm]{light_source1_crop}
\caption{Light source and its distribution system}
\label{fig:light_source}
\end{figure*} 

The load capacity of the motorized stage is \SI{30}{\kilo\gram}, which is sufficient for all use cases.
It is driven by three stepping motors with a minimum step of \SI{1.56}{\micro\meter}.
The travel range in the horizontal direction and vertical direction is \SI{60}{\milli\meter} and \SI{70}{\milli\meter} respectively.
Thus the maximum scanning area is $60mm\times60mm$, which covers the size of the majority of PMTs.
The third direction with a travel range of $15mm$ is added to control the gap between the fibre and the tube's cathode surface.
This may also be useful when extra space is needed for unmounting tubes without disturbing the optical fibres. 
All stepping motors are controlled by a motion controller MPC07SP from Leetro~\cite{leetro}, which possesses a PCI interface for remote control.

\subsection{Light Source}
\label{sec:light_source}

A high-power blue LED~\cite{zlight}(\SI{3}{\watt}, \SIrange{465}{485}{\nano\meter}) coupled to a \SI{5}{\centi\meter} diameter integrating sphere is adoptted as the light source of the test bench.
The LED has been used before successfully in the monitoring and calibration system of Neutron Wall Detector at IMP~\cite{yuyuhong_led} and proved to be suitable for massive light distribution.
The integrating sphere, which is coated interiorly with highly reflective material($\approx$\SI{98}{\percent} at \SI{400}{\nano\meter}), is used to convert the LED into a uniform light source.
To get better heat dissipation, the LED is fixed on a special designed base using thermally conductive silicone rubber and then coupled to the sphere directly making the whole sphere as its heat sink.
The uniformity of the light source has been verified using a Hamamastu R4443 Mod2 PMT read out by the groud test electronics of DAMPE(Sec.\ref{sec:application}). 
The result is shown in Fig.\ref{fig:uniformity_integratingsphere}. 
An uniformity within \textpm\SI{0.5}{\percent} has been reached, which makes the coupling between the light source and fibre bundle much easier and additional calibration for the spatial effect of the light source not needed. 

\begin{figure}[h!]
 \centering
 \includegraphics[width=90mm]{uniformity_integratingsphere}
\caption{Spatial uniformity of the integrating sphere.}

 \includegraphics[width=90mm]{intesityVSvoltage}
\caption{Light intensity as a function of AFG3252 pulse voltage}
\label{fig:afg3252_intensityVSvoltage}
\end{figure} 

An off the shelf hardware, Tektronix AFG3252 arbitrary/ function generator, is adpoted as the LED driver.
As a commertial product, it possesses a rich set of interfaces for remote control.
All the pulse parameters of AFG3252 can be adjusted in a wide range with high precison as show in Table \ref{tab:afg3252} and an example is given in Fig.\ref{fig:afg3252_intensityVSvoltage}.
This is a critical feature for a test bench with an objective of versatiltiy, as diverse requirements for the light source exist for different applications.
AFG3252 also has two analog outputs which can be synchronized together.
Thus it be used as a trigger generator at the same time it driving the LED, which will symplify the DAQ configuration in most use cases. 
All these features make it an effective replacement of a dedicated LED driver. 
After all, a stability better than \SI{0.5}{\percent} has been achieved after light intensity calibration, the details of which will be given in Sec.\ref{sec:performance}.

 Interface     & GPIB, LAN, USB
 \end{tabular}
 \end{center}
\end{table} 

\begin{comment}
One limitation of AFG3252 is that it has a limited leading edge of \SI{2.5}{ns}.
This may not be suitable for timing-related characterizations, where ultra-short(down to hundreds of \si{\pico\second} magnitude) light pulse is preferred.
In this case, a dedicated LED driver of special design(commertial or home-made)shall be used instead.
However the rich interfaces AFG3252 possesses still make it valuable as a trigger generator to control both the LED driver and DAQ remotely. 
\end{comment}

\subsection{Fibre Bundle}
\label{sec:fibre_bundle}

A bundle of 35(25 for test, 2 for reference and 13 spares) plastic clad silica fibres is utilized to distribute light to each PMT under test.
The fibres are \SI{1.5}{\meter} long and have a \SI{400}{\micro\meter} diameter core and a \SI{550}{\micro\meter} diameter cladding.
The numerical aperture(NA) is 0.37.
The relatively large core and large NA make the fibre an efficient light extracter of integrating sphere output. 
For easier manipulation and to protect the fibres from mechanical stress, both ends of the fibre bundle are coated with stainless steel ferrules.
The bundle end is coupled to the centre of the output port of integrating sphere using a stable fibre alignment stage.
On the other end, each fibre is fixed using a customized fibre holder which allows two-dimensional position adjustment.
In each test run, all used fibres will aligned to the centre of their corresponding PMT's input window with a precision of \SI{0.5}{\milli\meter}.  

\begin{figure}[h!]
 \centering
 \includegraphics[width=90mm]{fibre_diff}
\caption{Transmission difference of the fibres}
\label{fig:fibre_diff}
\end{figure} 

After coupling to the integrating sphere, the light output of each fibre is measured and a variance of \SI{10}{\percent} is observed among the fibres. 
As the un-uniformity of the light source(see Sec.\ref{sec:light_source}) is much less than the mesurement result, the result is a direct reflection of the transmition difference among the fibres.
Plus, the result also shows no dependency on the light intesity used(see Fig.\ref{fig:fibre_diff}). 
This is within expectation, because transmition coefficient is an intrinsic characteristic of the fibre itself.
The transmition difference got here will be used for light intensity correction in the relative gain measurement,see Sec.\ref{sec:psd_gain}.
%%The testing configuration includes two R4443 Mode PMTs, one for light source monitoring and the other one for fibre testing.
%%As stable fixture for the tubes and fibres are utilitized, the major uncertainty comes from the coupling distance between the fibre and the PMT in the longitudinal direction.


\subsection{Electronics and High Voltage Supply}
\label{sec:electronics}

\begin{comment}
To get more realistic results, electronics for PSD ground test is utilitized for the PMT test.
It consists of a front end electronics(FEE) box and a data acquisition(DAQ) board.
Both of them are standalone devices powered by a standalone DC power.
The FEE is based on the same design as the flight model of PSD, except that it uses commertial grade components instead.

Signals from R4443-Mod2 are connected to the FEE box directly and undergo charge integration and pusle shaping there.
Trigger signal from AFG3252 is connected to the DAQ board, which then dispatch the trigger to the FEE box.
Upon recieving the trigger, FEE will hold and digitize the shaped signal and transmit the digits to the DAQ board for packaging.
The packaged data are finally readout by a computer through the USB port on the DAQ board.
Commands from computer are sent to the DAQ board through a RS232 serial port.
Both the USB and serial interface are controlled using the NI-VISA library.
\end{comment}

A CAMAC system based on Wiener CC-USB control board has been set up for data acquisition.
This system is ready to use and shall be adequate for fast PMT characterization in the laboratoy.
However, it shall be noted that the DAQ system of the test bench is expected to change frequently, as customized electronics with different control interface may be preferred in some project.

A mainframe from CAEN, SY1527LC, is adoptted as the high voltage supply system of the test bench.
While HV boards of various properties can be housed in SY1527LC, the same control interface will be used for all kinds of operation.
This feature simplifies our implementation of the test bench as a versatile equipment.More information about SY1527LC can be found in~\cite{sy1527lc}.

\subsection{Software}
\label{sec:software}

\begin{figure*}[b]
\centering
 \includegraphics[width=140mm]{software_framework}
\caption{General PMT testing framework}
\label{fig:software_framework}
\end{figure*}

Software is a critical part of the test bench.
Instead of a 
The software is developped under Windows and written in C++ which is well suited for the modular design of the test bench.
To facilitate maintainence and future upgrade,it is groupped into three hierarchies as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
 \item \textit{Device abstraction}, which not only serves as an interface to the underlying hardwares, but also handles the abstraction of different types of devices. 
 \item \textit{Framework libraries}, which defines a general testing pecedure and provides utility classes for configuration and management.
 \item \textit{User inerface}, which provides command line based or graphical executables for user interaction. 
\end{enumerate}

Designed as a versatile equipment, different hardware modules may be used in the future.
For example, while the general-purpose CAMAC DAQ system may meet the demands of most of the use cases, some experiments may prefer to use project-specific DAQ hardware for testing,see Sec.{sec:application}.
In another case, a laser light source with a ultra-short pulsing driver may be used for timing-related characterization.
Instead of developping a dedicated program each time a hardware interface changes, an abstraction of the devices is adoptted to separate the testing procedure from hardware implementation details. 
Abstract classes are defined for four frequently-used devices in PMT testing, i.e. motion controller, pulse generator, DAQ system and HV supplier, as shown in rounded boxes in Fig.\ref{fig:testbench_overveiw}.
Common operations of each type of device are extracted and encapsulated in the corresponding abstract class, which are the only interface to higher level software components.
Concrete classes inheritted from the same abstract class represent different devices of the same type.
Currently, device classes for MPC07SP motion controller, AFG3252 pulse generator, SY1527LC power supply system and PSD DAQ board for ground test are implemented.
DAQ device class for the CAMAC system based on CC-USB controller is also implemented and thoroughly tested.

Built upon the abstract device inerface, a general testing framework is defined.
As a first step, all used concrete device classes shall be registered in the singlton class \textit{PTDeviceManager}.
Devices are then retrieved from \textit{PTDeviceManager} during test, thus making the rest of the framework independent from specific hardwares.
The testing procedures are then grouped as shown in Fig.\ref{fig:software_framework}.
A \textit{PTVProgram} represents the measurement procedure for a specific characteristic of PMT, such as cathode uniformity, gain, dark count rate, and so on.
\textit{PTVTest} is a subunit of \textit{PTVProgram}, which encapsulates the real testing operations performed under a specific condition.
A typical implementation for \textit{PTVTest} using fake code is presented in the third column of Fig.\ref{fig:software_framework}.
Usually, a \textit{PTVProgram} consists of a series of \textit{PTVTest}s, which are invoked sequentially in a test loop.
For example, for cathode uniformity test, the stepping motor will move to a series of positions and the PMT response will be recorded by the DAQ system at each position.
Here, device operations performed at each position constitute a \textit{PTVTest} and tests at all positions constitute a \textit{PTVProgram}.
Additional actions may be added in the \textit{PreTest} method and \textit{PostTest} method of \textit{PTVProgram}, which will be invoked before and after the test loop repectively.
Typically, PMT warming shall be performed in \textit{PreTest} and analysis code shall be added in \textit{PostTest}.
\textit{PTVProgram}s of different testing objectives will finally be chained together to constitute a complete characterization of PMT.

Based on the framework library, a light-weight user interface based on PDCurses~\cite{pdcurses} has been developped.
This program features in testing control, status monitoring and logging.
Thanks to the abstraction described above, the architecture of the program is rather independent of the specific hardware used and testing program performed.
A decoding function from binary file to root file~\cite{root} is also incorporated into it.
However, detailed analysis of the testing data is not part of the program as this is rather project-specific and is not within the scope of the program's function.
It is left to the user of the test bench to develop an independent program to do this job.

\section{Characteristics of the test bench}
\label{sec:char_testbench}

\subsection{Spatial Uniformity of Integrating Sphere}
\label{sec:spatialuniformity_insph}

Before coupling to the fibre bundle,the spatial uniformity of the light source(LED + Integrating Sphere) is investigated. 
A single optical fibre of the same type as the fibre bundle in the test bench is utilitized.
One end of the fibre is fixed on a three-dimensional alignment stage and used to scan the output port horizontally and vertically in a \SI{1}{\milli\meter} step.
The other end is readout by a PMT of R4443-Mod2 and processed by the electronics of PSD groud test.
The LED is driven by a \SI{40}{\nano\second} width pulse of fixed amplitude at \SI{500}{\Hz}.
%The same LED signal is used during the scanning.

The result(Fig.~\ref{fig:uniformity_integratingsphere}) shows that the integrating sphere works as expected and the light intensity is almost the same(within \textpm0.5\%) over the entire surface of the output port.
