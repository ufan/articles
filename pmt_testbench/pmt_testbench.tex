%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%  Introduction  %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

DArk Matter Paricle Explorer(DAMPE)\cite{Chang_Jin_dampe} is a satellite-borne particle detector for dark matter search and cosmic ray study.
It is designed to cover the energy range from 5~GeV to 10~TeV for electrons and photons with an energy resolution of 1\% at 800~GeV,from 100~GeV to 1~PeV for heavy ions with an energy resolution better than 40\% at 800~GeV.

Plastic scintillator Strip Detector(PSD),which sits at the topmost of the satellite,is a key component of DAMPE detector.
By measuring the energy deposit of particles pentrating through it,PSD serves as a anti-coincidence detector for e/$\gamma$ discrimination as well as a detector for charge measurement up to Z=20.
PSD consists of 82 plastic scintillator strips(EJ-200\cite{ej200}) of dimention $864mm\times28mm\times10mm$,each readout at both ends by a Hamamastu R4443-Mod2 photomultiplier tube.
These strips are arranged into two orthogonally oriented layers,convering an effective area of $820mm\times820mm$.
Each PMT is readout at both dynode 5 and dynode 8 with different gains to cover the large dynamic range from $\sim$0.5~MIPs to $\sim$700~MIPs.
The readout signals are processed by a highly-sensitive ASIC chip(VA32) with the range of 0-14~pC,and then digitized by an ADC with 14~bits resolution.

Unlike groud-based experiments,the power supply system of DAMPE payload can only provide discrete high voltage levels with an interval of 30~V.
Furthermore,every 6 or 7 PMTs of PSD form a HV-group and will share the same high voltage channel.
In this case,the ususal method of fine-tuning individual PMT's high voltage to get optimal gain is not available.  
The characteristics of PMTs in the same HV-group should have similar dependency on voltage.
Thus a careful selection of the tubes is mandatory to get consistent energy response across the whole detector and optimal utilization of the mesuring range.
For this selection,the gain of dynode 5 and dynode 8 as a function of supplying voltage needs to be measured precisely.  

On the other hand,the harsh environment of satellite imposes a strict set of quality control processes for the production of PMT modules,as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:production_procedure}.
A PMT module is composed of a bare PMT tube,baseboards for HV supply and signal readout,silicone rubber for coupling with the palstic scintillator,pouring sealant to protect PMT from vibration and HV breakdown and the supporting Aluminum box.

\caption{Production Procedures of a PMT module.The PMT should be tested during the selection phase and qualification phase}
\label{fig:production_procedure}
\end{figure} 
Some of the PMT modules may get irreversible deterioration,even damage,during these processes.
Thus a qualification test shall be performed to certificate the performance of each PMT module before final installation. 

Considering the large number of tubes involved in the Selection phase and Qualification phase,a PMT test facility for bulk testing was designed and contructed to facilitate this work.
Totally,500 bare R4443-Mod2 tubes were thoroughly tested for PSD and 200 of them were selected for production and qualification.
While mainly developped for the DAMPE-PSD project,this test facility has been designed to be as versatile as possible and can be upgaded seamlessly for future experiments.
The detailed description of the test facility will be given in Sec.\ref{sec:description}.Some key characteristics of the test facility is summarized in Sec.\ref{sec:char_testfacility}.
The testing results of PSD PMTs and the corresponding selection criteria will be discussed in Sec.\ref{sec:pmt_test}.
